Set Financial Goals: Users can set goals (e.g., saving a certain amount) and track their progress towards them based on their current savings and expenses.

 # Animations
To enhance user experience, we've incorporated the following animations:

Fade-in/Fade-out: Applied when charts are updated to give a smooth transition between data changes.
Hover Effects: Subtle hover effects on buttons and chart elements to make the app more interactive and responsive to user actions.

The Personal Finance Manager is fully responsive and adapts to various screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

# Future Enhancements
Authentication: Add user login and registration (optional future feature).
Data Export: Allow users to export their financial data as a CSV or PDF.

Backend Integration: In the future, the app can be integrated with a backend to allow for multi-user support and cloud data storage.
